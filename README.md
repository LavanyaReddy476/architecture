# Architecture
#We want to see how you think we should organize the application to meet the business needs.
The spring boot api is chosen for backend api primarily as I am familiar with it and have applied for the same. Since this is a simple backend application node js would be the primary choice otherwise.

React frontend is chosen
React can be used to easily implement any UI application.

# What components do we need? 
We need a backend and a frontend to solve this problem

# What libraries do we need? 
Libraries that we need for spring boot are : web - starter, testing library, actuator (generally used-can be omitted), lombok(generally used but can be omitted), 
open api dependencies(for documenting), dev tools
React - this can be implemented using minimun dependencies. Have added react-router and created app using npx create-react-app

# What libraries can we omit?
we can omit many libraries in this case. We need only web client, documentation and testing libraries in spring boot case. But rest of the libraries are added for ease of development, extendability and standardizing the implementation
For react it needs only native react libraries as all the solutions could be solved by only using react and fetch.

apart from Libraries, node and Java installation is mandatory in this case
